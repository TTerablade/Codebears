    <p>Do you think video games are bad for kids?</p>
<p> Some people believe they can be harmful because they might make kids spend too much time sitting and playing instead of being active.</p>
    <p> Also, some games have violence, which could make kids act differently or cause trouble in their daily life. Video games really aren't good for kids.
</p>
<p>Firstly, playing video games can make kids less active. When kids spend a lot of time sitting and playing video games, they might not get enough exercise. Instead of running around or playing outside, they're sitting still for a long time. Not having enough physical activity can be bad for their health and can even lead to paralyzation to the body.Parlization could be caused by an artery in your neck or brain. It also can be caused by damage to your brain or spinal cord.</p>
    <p>All of these would happen in your gaming sessions. Additionally, staring at screens for too long exposes them to too much blue light produced by the screen which can damage your retinal and can can hurt their eyes and might worsen eyesight faster which could lead to blindness or eyeglasses. 
</p>
    <p>Another way video games could have a negative effect is violence. Exposure to violence or inappropriate things  in video games can have  long lasting effects on children's  lives and their growth. When kids are regularly exposed to violence in games, they might start to believe violence is a normal way to solve problems or talk  with others. As they start to play more violence video games the more that violence could be applied in the real world . Additionally, Violence can cause physical injury as well as harm. Also they might cuase thing’s such as robbery,crime,and any other kind of violence. All of thase could lead to dipresson, stress, and pain. Violent video games also can affect the behavior of the child as the child may have an increase of aggression or even stealing or fighting.

</p>

    <p>While you may think some video games teach you good hand coronation and developing problem solving skills which is true, that's not all you can’t just think of the mental health of your child. One thing many people don’t think about is the physical effects that could happen to the child  . Playing video games can make kids less active. When kids spend a lot of time sitting and playing video games, they might not get enough exercise. So even when you learn more you could still have huge problems in the future! staring at screens for too long exposes them to too much blue light produced by the screen which can damage your retinal and can can hurt their eyes and might worsen eyesight Violence can cause physical injury as well as harm. Also they might cuase thing’s such as robbery,crime,and any other kind of violence. All of thase could lead to dipresson, stress, and pain.
